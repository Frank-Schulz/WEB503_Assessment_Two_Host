During this assignment, I spent a lot of my time learning and working with Jekyll as a result other things have had less effort put into them, and not because I didn't want to do them. This mainly includes my deveploment journal and code commenting/documentation which are both practically non-existant.

Ultimately I'm happy with what I've learned while working on this assessment but I'm not happy with what I'm handing in as it is still lacking.
